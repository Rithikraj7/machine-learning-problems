## 1.	Build a Random Forest Classifier to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. The dataset contains customer information, such as contract length, usage patterns, and customer demographics. The goal is to identify customers who are likely to churn so that the company can take proactive measures to retain them.

## 2. You have access to a dataset containing information about student performance, including attributes like study hours, previous grades, and family background. Develop a linear regression model to predict a student's final exam score. Analyze the impact of different features on the predicted score and provide insights into factors influencing student performance

## 3.	Imagine you are working for a retail store, and you have historical sales data, as well as information about promotions, holidays, and customer foot traffic. Construct a linear regression model to forecast future sales for the store. Validate the model's accuracy and visualize the predicted sales trends
